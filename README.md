# [IdaPay](http://idapay.org/)

We all came together in community support to save the impending destruction of a coin we had all invested time and money into; IdaPay.  After several challenges with the original remaining developer, we were forced to begin anew.  This repository is the new parent codebase for IdaPay, as we move it forward.  Please come join the community on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/g3gxy6x) and help out!
